## 🚀 How to Work on this Assignment

### 1. Setup
1.  **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2.  Open the folder in VS Code (or your preferred editor).

### 2. Complete the Experiments
* Navigate to the specific folder (e.g., `cd exp01`).
* Open the `main.py` or `app.py` file.
* Look for the `# TODO` comments and write your code there.
* **Important:** Do not rename files or folders!

### 3. Answer Theory Questions
* Open `THEORY.md` in the root folder.
* Type your answers directly under each question.

### 4. Test Your Code
* Run the script locally to check if it works:
    ```bash
    python exp01/main.py
    ```

### 5. Submit & Grade
* Commit and Push your changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Finished Exp 1"
    git push origin main
    ```
* Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your GitHub repository.
* ✅ **Green Check:** You passed the tests!
* ❌ **Red X:** Something failed. Click on it to see the error message.

## ⚠️ Important Rules
1.  **Do not delete** `requirements.txt` or the `tests/` folder.
2.  **Do not rename** the experiment folders (e.g., keep it `exp01`, not `Experiment 1`).
3.  Wrap your main execution logic in `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks for scripts.
